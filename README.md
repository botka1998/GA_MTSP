# GA_MTSP

Solution for the multilple traveling salesman problem using genetic algorithm, all written from scratch in python. 
Random targets are generated inside the working area of two industrial robots, the targets are then distributed between the two robots and arranged in an order with minimized execution time. 
I used and modified [ABB_Open](https://github.com/robotics/open_abb) for communication with ABB RobotStudio.
